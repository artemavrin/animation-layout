        "name": "Mercury",
        "description": "The smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. Mercury has a rocky, cratered surface similar to Earth's Moon. Its extreme proximity to the Sun creates dramatic temperature variations, ranging from -180°C at night to 430°C during the day. The planet has no atmosphere and no moons, making it a harsh, unchanging environment. Its surface is marked by numerous impact craters, demonstrating billions of years of meteorite bombardment. Mercury's unique composition includes a large metallic core that takes up about 60% of its mass, making it the most dense planet in the solar system.",

        "name": "Venus", 
        "description": "Often called Earth's 'sister planet' due to similar size and mass, Venus is a world of extreme conditions. Its thick atmosphere is composed primarily of carbon dioxide, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in our solar system. The surface pressure is 90 times that of Earth, comparable to the pressure at 900 meters underwater. Unique among planets, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, with a single Venusian day lasting longer than its year. The planet is completely covered in volcanic landscapes, with over 1,600 major volcanoes, though most are believed to be dormant.",

        "name": "Earth",
        "description": "The only known planet supporting complex life, Earth is a remarkable blue and green jewel in the solar system. Approximately 71% of its surface is covered by water, creating diverse ecosystems from polar ice caps to tropical rainforests. The planet has a unique magnetic field that protects it from solar radiation and allows life to thrive. Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, supporting a complex biosphere with millions of species. The planet has one large moon that stabilizes its axial tilt, creating consistent seasonal patterns and supporting complex life cycles.",

        "description": "Known as the 'Red Planet' due to its iron-rich surface, Mars has captured human imagination for centuries. It has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is three times the height of Mount Everest. The planet features a thin atmosphere, massive dust storms that can cover the entire planet, and evidence of ancient water flows. Two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, orbit the planet. Scientists consider Mars the most likely location for potential past or present extraterrestrial microbial life in our solar system.",

        "description": "The largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter is a massive gas giant with a complex system of storms and winds. Its Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for at least 350 years and could fit two to three Earths inside it. Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet and over 75 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. The planet's composition is similar to that of a star, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and it's believed to have a rocky core.",

        "description": "Famous for its spectacular ring system, Saturn is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Its rings, spanning over 280,000 kilometers, are made of ice, rock, and dust particles. The planet has over 82 known moons, with Titan being the largest - bigger than the planet Mercury and the only moon in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere. Saturn's density is so low that if placed in a massive ocean, it would float. The planet experiences winds that can reach up to 1,800 kilometers per hour at its equator.",

        "name": "Uranus",
        "description": "A unique ice giant that rotates on its side, with its axis tilted at nearly 98 degrees. This extreme tilt creates bizarre seasonal variations where each pole experiences 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus is composed mainly of ices such as water, ammonia, and methane, giving it a distinctive blue-green color. The planet has a complex system of 27 known moons and a faint ring system. Its unusual magnetic field is offset from its rotational axis, creating a strange magnetic environment.",

        "description": "The windiest planet in our solar system, Neptune experiences the fastest winds recorded on any planet, reaching speeds up to 2,100 kilometers per hour. Its vibrant blue color comes from methane in the atmosphere. The planet features a massive storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, called the Great Dark Spot. Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest - an unusual moon that orbits in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation. The planet was the first discovered through mathematical calculations rather than direct observation.",
